Our product is NetworkZone, a website that allows users to run internet speed tests on their device and find the locations, or zones, with the best internet speeds in their area. The application accomplishes this by collecting internet speed and location data from users, and storing it in a database. The program then sifts through the database to find the best internet speed, and displays said speed and the location in which it was measured on the webpage. Users are able to view the location of the fastest internet speed, and run their own speed test to contribute to the database. This product is unique because it is the only application that uses crowdsourcing to find the locations with the best internet speeds in an area. Previous iterations of this product involved the user running speed tests in different locations, and manually comparing the speeds to find the best location. Our product eliminates the need for the user to do any manual work, as the website compares and presents the best location for them. Other iterations compared internet speeds tested by one user in multiple locations. However, this is impractical since students of Dublin High School, our target audience, generally do not have enough time to walk all around campus conducting speed tests in order to find the best location. Our product allows users to immediately find the location with the best internet speed because of our use of crowdsourcing.
